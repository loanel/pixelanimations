# pixelanimations
Simple project for animating pixel movements in JavaFx.

Initial inspiration was a part of the clicker game Universal Paperclips, try it here:

At a certain point in the game an animation appears that mimic spaceship combat. 
The animation is a small window with pixels that represent ships, and move accordingly to simulate "combat". My inital goal was to recreate the behaviour of this game, but on a bigger scale (10000 ships in a single animation field), over time i decided to add multiple other functions to allow simulating pixel movement in the gamefield, not only pixel collision/combat.

Implmenetation is done in JavaFx, i'm sure that using a real game engine would be miles better for this purpose but i mainly wanted to recreate ship behaviour and also play around with various collision configurations and pixel movements.
